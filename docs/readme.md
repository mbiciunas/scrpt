*Note that Terminix is changing it's name to Tilix due to a trademark issue with the Terminix International Corporation. It may take a few weeks to complete the process, thank you in advance for your patience while we work through this change.*

### About

Tilix is a tiling terminal emulator which uses the VTE GTK+ 3 widget with the following features:

* Layout terminals in any fashion by splitting them horizontally or vertically
* Terminals can be re-arranged using drag and drop both within and between windows
* Terminals can be detached into a new window via drag and drop
* Input can be synchronized between terminals so commands typed in one terminal are replicated to the others
* The grouping of terminals can be saved and loaded from disk
* Terminals support custom titles
* Color schemes are stored in files and custom color schemes can be created by simply creating a new file
* Transparent background
* Background images
* [About Us](https://github.com/mbiciunas/scrpt/docs/about_us) support (i.e. drop-down terminal)
* Custom hyperlinks
* Automatic (triggered) profile switches based on hostname and directory
